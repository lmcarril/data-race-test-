#ThreadSanitizer	
```
  todo:
  ThreadSanitizer is not yet supported on Darwin amd64
```
This project aims to create a test suite for helgrind 
(a data race detection tool, part of valgrind, http://www.valgrind.org)
and potentially any other data race detector.

Hopefully, everything really useful from this project will 
eventually be merged into the 'official' helgrind.
